# Update Complete

I have fixed the RLS policies and updated the code to handle `user_id` correctly.
These changes have been pushed to GitHub (branch: `main`).

## Next Steps
1. **Run SQL Script**: Ensure you run the `supabase_rls_setup.sql` script in your Supabase Dashboard to fix the missing column and policies.
2. **Verify App**: Reload the application. You should now see your data and be able to add new groups.
3. **Check Walkthrough**: See `walkthrough.md` for detailed verification steps.

If you encounter any further issues, please let me know.
